# Online-Todo-Application-using-Ajax &-Laravel-10 with MySQL Database Connection
I have made this project, where user needs to Sign-Up and then Log-In with proper Email &amp; Password to insert, update &amp; delete todo objects in the application. I use Laravel 10 Framaework with Ajax calling, to complete this project
To run this project-> unzip the file & go to myApp2 Copy file. In the file path, type CMD & after opening coomand promt write; "php artisan serve --port 1234". This will connect to laravel server. Now in browser type: "localhost:1234". This is hpw the project will run.
